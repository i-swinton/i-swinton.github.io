									<h1>One In A Krillion</h1>

								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>One In A Krillion is the project I worked on for my senior game class. The game is built utilizing the Unity game engine.
									The project was worked on for 8 months. I worked as a programmer and producer for this project. On the programming side, I focused on AI and Gameplay programming.
									</p>
								<h2>Skills</h2>
									<div class="row">
											<ul>
												<li><b>Unity C#:</b> Since this project was made in the Unity engine, the game scripted in C#.</li>
												<li><b>AI Programming:</b> I implemented the underlying behavior trees which the enemies use. For encounters, I developed a system which allows encounters to dynamically adjust which enemy is attacking the player at a given time. </li>
												<li><b>Gameplay Programming:</b> Programmed some of the player's special attacks, the "Krill-Nado" and the "Krizzors". Implemented hitbox/hurtbox interface system. Added a knockdown system to stun enemies after players perform combos on them. </li>
												<li><b>Tools Programming:</b> Created a behavior tree editor in engine to allow simpler editing and behavior tree managment.</li>
												<li><b>Task Delegation:</b> As the producer, I worked with to team establish priority tasks to complete the game
													and worked with the other leads to hand out the tasks to other team members.</li>
											</ul>
									</div>
								<h2>Team</h2>
									<p>This project had a team of 9 team members. There were 7 programmers, 1 game designer, and 1 part-time artists.</p>
								<h2>Lessons</h2>
										<div >
											<ul>
												<li><b>Adapting the Process:</b> During this project, there were a lot difficulties in maintaing solid schedules for the team. As such, 
												I ended up adapting Scrum's Sprint Review, Planning, and Retrospective to be shorter while still maintaining the sense of a goal and 
												direction for the tasks at hand. </li>
												<li><b>Developing Engaging Enemies:</b> I also took the role of combat designer during this project. I ended up doing a lot of research into what
												behaviors and organization of enemies make for interesting and engaging encounters. This allowed me to design the Enemy AI to not only fight the player,
											but to control the curves that the enemies engage with the player, preventing the player from being overwhelmed or bored. </li>
												</ul>
