									<h1>Safe and Sound</h1>
									<p>Safe and Sound is a strategy game centered on survival. You must lead a colony of survivors to rebuild their hostile environment. 
									Order them to build structures, mine resources, and control the defenses against the hostile aliens.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Safe.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>Safe and Sound is the project I worked on for my second semester freshman game class. The game is built within a C++ engine partially built by the team.
									The project was worked on for 4 months. I worked as a programmer, focused on implementing the game's AI and UI systems.</p>
								<h2>Skills</h2>
									<div class="row">
											<ul>
												<li><b>C++:</b> The game is written entirely in C++.</li>
												<li><b>AI Programming:</b> I implemented the enemy and survivor AI. The player can issue orders to the suviovrs using the bar at the bottom of the screen.
												They both wander when undisturbed, and can pathfind to target locations using A* pathfinding.</li>
												<li><b>UI Programming:</b> I worked on implementing UI of the game, ranging from the prompts to the command bar at the bottom of the screen.
													The prompts are coded to be flexible, allowing the caller to change the text, buttons, and button events when interacted with. </li>

											</ul>
									</div>
								<h2>Team</h2>
									<p>The team consisted of 5 programmers. I was placed of creating the game's UI and implementing the AI of all the entities within the level.</p>
								<h2>Lessons</h2>
										<div >
											<ul>
												<li><b>Pairs Programming/Deubgging: </b>There were a plethora of times where team members would get stuck on problem while programming. To resolve this, 
												we would often pull another programmer aside to quickly get help and help unblock ourselves and any other tasks behind us. By working together on these issues
												we were able to swiftly overcome our hurdles and keep the project on a good pace.</li>
											</ul>
