									<h1>Scrap and Battery</h1>
									<p>"Scrap and Battery" is an action game with roguelite elements. You play as a robot escaping a facility by fighting off enemies with a host of random weapons. 
									Make your way through seven levels and see if you can escape the facility!</p>

								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>"Scrap and Battery" is the project I worked on for my junior game class. The game is built within Unreal Engine 5.
									The project was worked on for 8 months. I worked as a programmer and producer for this project. On the programming side, I handled programming the UI, 
									player animation calling, UX effects (such as hitstop), and much others.
									</p>
								<h2>Skills</h2>
									<div class="row">
											<ul>
												<li><b>C++:</b> The game is built in UE5, and some of the mechanics are coded in Unreal's C++.</li>
												<li><b>UI Programming</b>: Implemented the player HUD and prompt system. Utilized Unreal C++ to make system for helping with UI animation. I also implemented the 
													tooltips and demonstration videos on the pause and store screens. </li>
												<li><b>Gameplay Programmer</b>: Implemented some player abilities for the player to use. I also worked on improving some of the gameplay's UX, 
												such as hitstop and battery tracking.  </li>
												<li><b>Task Delegation:</b> As the producer, I worked with to team establish priority tasks to complete the game
													and worked with the other leads to hand out the tasks to other team members.</li>
											</ul>
									</div>
								<h2>Team</h2>
									<p>The game was produced with an 8 person team. I served as the project's producer, UI programmer and generalist programmer.</p>
								<h2>Lessons</h2>
										<div >
											<ul>
												<li><b>Unreal UI: </b>On the technical side of things, this project taught me a lot about UI editors and how to program features to interact with them. 
												After a long amount of time fighting Unreal UI, I ended understanding it a bit better in the end, allowing some of the cooler effects to take place. 
											I also learned how to integrate C++ into unreal UI, as can be seen from collecting scraps from the ground.</li>
												<li><b>Strike Group Development:</b> The team I worked with this year was very tech-centric. To prevent us from focusing too much on tech, we divided 
												ourselves into strike groups to each take a feature under our wings to manage. This allowed elements like sound, level design, and art to maintain a roughly 
												even pace with the rest o fthe tech developments. This also helped me create more effective meetings as a team, as many smaller decsions could be
												left for the respective strike group to manage.</li>
													
											</ul>
